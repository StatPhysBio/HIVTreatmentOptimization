This is a collection of analysis intermediate and final outputs
They are stored as HDF5 files for interoperability between Mathematica/Julia 
	and other programming languages.
Data are processed using Mathematica code in GeneticViremicAnalysis.
Posteriors are sampled and simulations run in JuliaScripts.

The posteriors are stored in snpanalysis.h5
